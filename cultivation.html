            <h3><u>Fruits Cultivation</u></h3>
            <p>The site of a fruit-growing enterprise is as significant in determining its success as the varieties
              grown. In fact, variety and site together set a ceiling on the productivity and profit that can be
              realized under the best management. In most developed fruit regions microclimatic conditions (climate at
              plant height, as influenced by slight differences in soil, soil covering, and elevation) and soil
              conditions are the two components of a site that determine its desirability for a fruit-growing
              enterprise. Sometimes (particularly with highly perishable fruits) transportation to market must also be
              considered.

              Local conditions at a site that expose it to unusual frost hazard are as detrimental to citrus in Florida
              as they are to peach trees in New Zealand and apple trees in the south of England. In regions and sites
              where temperatures during the season may drop no more than a few degrees below freezing, artificial frost
              protection is sometimes used. This is accomplished by open-flame burning (petroleum bricks, logs, etc.) or
              heating of metal objects with oil, gas, propane, electricity, etc. (stones or stacks that radiate heat).
              Another technique is the spraying of water on plants (e.g., strawberries) as long as the temperature is
              below freezing.

              For highest productivity, most fruit trees must root extensively to a depth of three feet (one metre) or
              more. Heavy subsoil or other conditions causing imperfect internal drainage may result in shallow, weak
              root systems that do not take water and nutrients efficiently from the soil. In semi- <span
                class="clear">arid and arid regions, accumulation of saline soils in a subsurface layer sometimes limits
                rooting of fruit trees, causes abnormal foliar symptoms, and reduces yields. Tiling and surface ditching
                help decrease water accumulation in poorly drained subsoils and reduce wet spots in otherwise
                satisfactory sites. Special control of irrigation procedures and periodic leaching may alleviate the
                worst salt effects in saline soils. Choice of tolerant species, varieties, and rootstocks may make fruit
                growing economical on imperfectly drained or mildly saline sites, though plants rarely perform as well
                as they do on sites free from these difficulties. Coconuts, however, tolerate saline soil conditions
                near tropical saltwater coasts.

                Once selected, a site is cleared, levelled (if needed), and cultivated. Then drainage, irrigation, and
                road systems are installed as required. In rolling or sloping terrain, where contour planting is needed
                to control erosion and conserve moisture, the locations of the plant or row positions are determined by
                the contour terraces and waterways established. In old lands, nematode or other pest populations make
                fumigation necessary before planting. In some problem California soils, giant plows and treaded tractors
                turn the soil to depths of three to six feet (one to two metres). In very infertile sites, or sites
                where the physical condition of the surface soil is poor, it may be helpful to grow a succession of
                leguminous cover crops for a year or more before planting and/or apply a fertilizer containing major
                fertilizer elements (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, sulfur) and all or certain trace elements
                (iron, manganese, boron, zinc, copper, molybdenum) and lime, based on a soil test.</span></p>

            <h3><u>Vegitables Cultivation</u></h3>
            <p>The broad bed and furrow technology (BBF) is developed for vegetable cultivation in the coastal low lands
              by manipulating land and making of broad beds of 4–5 m wide and furrows of 6–7 m alternatively. Broad beds
              are made in the shape of inverted trapezium by digging soil from either side of the bed and putting in the
              bed area by cut and fill method (Fig. 23.12). The depressed area is used for rice + fish culture and
              raised bed for vegetable crops during rainy season. The broad bed area can be used for either crops
              rotation of two medium and one short duration crop such as bhindi-brinjal-radish from mid-April to
              mid-January or for single long duration crop such as ginger or turmeric from May to January. On such beds
              vegetables such as French bean, cowpea, tomato, capsicum, chillies, cluster bean etc. can be grown
              successfully. After harvesting of rice in the furrows, the area can be put under oil seed crops, besides
              suitable vegetables during dry season (Velmurugan et al., 2015). The system also increases the cropping
              intensity from the present level of 100% in the rice to 250%–300% in the beds and 200% in the furrows of
              the broad bed-furrow system. This type of vegetable farming requires special skills and techniques. The
              crop is not ready for harvest when the edible portion of the plant reaches the stage of maturity; it must
              be carried through further stages of growth. Production under isolated conditions ensures the purity of
              seed yield. Special techniques are applied during the stage of flowering and seed development and also in
              harvesting and threshing the seeds. Temperature requirements are based on the minimum, optimum, and
              maximum temperatures during both day and night throughout the period of plant growth. Requirements vary
              according to the type and variety of the specific crop. Based on their optimum temperature ranges,
              vegetables may be classed as cool-season or warm-season types. Cool-season vegetables thrive in areas
              where the mean daily temperature does not rise above 70° F (21° C). This group includes the artichoke,
              beet, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, garlic, leek, lettuce, onion,
              parsley, pea, potato, radish, spinach, and turnip. Warm-season vegetables, requiring mean daily
              temperature of 70° F or above, are intolerant of frost. These include the bean, cucumber, eggplant, lima
              bean, okra, muskmelon, pepper, squash, sweet corn (maize), sweet potato, tomato, and watermelon.Premature
              seeding, or bolting, is an undesirable condition that is sometimes seen in fields of cabbage, celery,
              lettuce, onion, and spinach. The condition occurs when the plant goes into the seeding stage before the
              edible portion reaches a marketable size. Bolting is attributed to either extremely low or high
              temperature conditions in combination with inherited traits. Specific vegetable strains or varieties may
              exhibit significant differences in their tendency to bolt Young cabbage or onion plants of relatively
              large size may bolt upon exposure to low temperatures near 50° to 55° F (10° to 13° C). At high
              temperatures of 70° to 80° F (21° to 27° C) lettuce plants do not form heads and will show premature
              seeding. The fruit sets of tomatoes are adversely affected by relatively low and relatively high
              temperatures. Tomato breeders, however, have developed several new varieties, some setting fruits at a
              temperature as low as 40° F (4° C) and others at a temperature as high as 90° F (32° C). Climate involves
              the temperature, moisture, daylight, and wind conditions of a specific region. Climatic factors strongly
              affect all stages and processes of plant growth.

            <h3><u>Grain Cultivation</u></h3>
            <p>Most small grains prefer soils that are considered to be moderately well-drained to well-drained,
              with a desirable pH range of 5.8-6.8. Soil testing should be conducted far enough in advance of
              cereal grain production to adjust soil pH and fertility if necessary. Grain crops such as oats and rye
              are more tolerant of poorly-drained and low pH soils. Barley and wheat on the other hand are not as
              tolerant and will do best in well-drained soils with a pH of 6.3 or higher.
              When selecting sites for winter grain production, avoid fields that regularly pond during the winter
              as this can reduce winter survival rates. When selecting sites for spring grains choose fields that can
              be accessed in early spring (April to early May). Delayed plantings will often result in weed
              pressure from summer annuals and lower yields. Perennial weed problems are a primary factor in
              field selection. Fields with high populations of perennial grasses such as quackgrass should be
              avoided.Many organic crop rotations involve perennial sod crops. If you plan to follow a sod crop with a
              cereal grain make sure the sod is plowed under well in advance of grain planting. Our experience
              with organic grain production suggests that producers should not plant spring grains on fields where
              perennial sods have been plowed or tilled in the same spring. Fields that are coming out of perennial
              sods are best prepared in the summer and seeded in the fall with a winter grain or the following
              spring with a spring grain. Organic certification rules require that you try to source organically
              produced seed before usingconventional seed sources. You may also want to purchase “certified seed”. Certified seed is seed of
              a known variety produced under strict seed certification standards to maintain varietal purity. Seed
              lots must also meet specified standards for other crops, inert matter, weed seeds, and germination.
              Certified seed is also free of prohibited noxious weed seeds. All certified seed must pass field
              inspection, be conditioned by an approved seed conditioning plant, and then be sampled and pass
              laboratory testing before it can be sold as certified seed. If you do import seed that is not certified,
              check it closely for weed seeds or mixed grains prior to using. Additionally, non-certified seed may
              contain genetic lines that are unknown or variable.In no case is fungicide treated or genetically modified seed allowed in organic production. Many
              farmers grow and store their own seed for use the following year. In these situations, it is important
              to clean the seed lot of weed seeds and diseased seeds before using. Producers may also want to do
              a germination test before planting. Usually, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) needs can be met in part
              with manure and/or compost as well as other approved sources of these nutrients such as rock phosphate, bone meal and Sul-PoMag).
              Phosphorus and K requirements for fall grains are important for tillering and for winter
              survival. Deficiencies identified by a soil test in calcium, magnesium and sulfur should also be
              corrected using OMRI approved materials. If manure or compost is being used for a fertility source
              you should get an analysis of that material prior to application. The analysis will help determine the
              application rate needed to meet grain requirements. Standard soil tests provide a recommendation
              for nitrogen application based on grain species.In general, spring and winter grains require 50-80 pounds of nitrogen per acre. If you are applying
              manure or compost as a source of fertility, realize that not all the nitrogen in these sources will be
              available to the crop during the first season. Actual nitrogen availability is influenced by the type of
              manure or compost being applied and how quickly it is incorporated into the soil. Nitrogen
              availability ranges from 35 to 75% of the total N applied for manure and from 10-30% for compost.
              Plowing down a legume cover or a heavy legume sod can add significant plant available nitrogen to
              the soil and may meet all your nitrogen needs for a small grain crop. Be aware that organic
              certification requires a 90-day period between application of animal manures and harvest for grains
              entering the food grade market.
