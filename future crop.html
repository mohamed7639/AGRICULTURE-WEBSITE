                        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>FEED CROPS</u></h2>
                        <p class="p-align">Feed crops, such as oats and alfalfa, are harvested for livestock
                            consumption. These crops contain nutrients that animals need to develop. They are grown in
                            agricultural fields but can also be found in natural meadows and pastures.Forage crops are
                            important for livestock farming. Animals feed directly on forages, such as grasses. Forages
                            that are cut and fed to livestock while they are still fresh are called green chop. Alfalfa
                            is a popular crop fed to livestock as green chop.
                        <p>
                            Some forages are cut, allowed to dry in the field, and stored. These are called hay
                            crops.Another type of forage crop is silage. Silage crops are harvested, then stored under
                            conditions that allow the forage to break down (ferment) into acids. The wet, acidic silage
                            is fed to livestock such as cattle.Principle feed crops include corn, barley, wheat, and
                            oats. Each of these crops has different properties that are better suited for some animals’
                            diets over others.</p>
                        <p>
                            Barley, which is harder to digest, is most often fed to beef and dairy cattle because they
                            have a tough, four-chambered stomach. Hull-less barley, which is easier to digest, is fed to
                            swine and poultry.The production of feed crops has risen dramatically with increased demand
                            for meat worldwide. Increased production of feed crops has changed the agricultural
                            landscape.The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

                            In the agricultural practices of North America and northern Europe, barley, corn, oats, rye,
                            and sorghums are grown almost entirely as animal feed, although small quantities are
                            processed for human consumption as well. These grains are fed whole or ground, either singly
                            or mixed with high-protein oil meals or other by-products, minerals, and vitamins to form a
                            complete feed for pigs and poultry or an adequate dietary supplement for ruminants and
                            horses.</p>

                        <p>The production of grains is seasonal because of temperature or moisture conditions or a
                            combination of both. It is necessary to produce a full year’s supply during the limited
                            growing season. The grain is dried to 14 percent or less moisture to prevent sprouting or
                            molding; the grain is then stored in containers or buildings where insects and rodents
                            cannot destroy it. It is generally desirable to store more than a year’s supply of the
                            grains to be used as feed, because crop failures sometimes occur.</p>

                        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>FIBER CROPS</u></h2>
                        <P class="p-align">Fiber crops, such as cotton and hemp, are harvested for textile and paper
                            products. Textiles, or cloth, are made from the dried and processed fibers of certain
                            plants. Most fibers used to make textiles are taken from the stem or roots of plants such as
                            flax. Flax is used to make linen.

                            Other parts of a plant can be harvested for fiber. Cotton, the most popular fiber crop in
                            the world, is harvested from the light, fluffy “boll” of fiber that surrounds the plant’s
                            seeds. Textiles made from bamboo are manufactured from the pulp of bamboo plants.

                            Pulp from other fiber crops can be used in a variety of products. Fiber pulp may be used
                            instead of wood pulp to manufacture paper products.

                            The hemp plant is an interesting and controversial example of a fiber crop. The fibers of
                            the hemp plant are strong and durable, perfect for products such as paper, textiles, ropes,
                            nets, and sailcloth for ships. Hemp advocates see the plant as a versatile and ecological
                            source of fiber.

                            But some varieties of the hemp plant are used to make marijuana, a psychoactive drug.
                            Marijuana is illegal to grow and use in many parts of the United States. (The drug is
                            legally grown and sold for medical or recrecational use in some places.) Opponents of hemp
                            argue that increased harvesting of hemp crops will lead to increased production and use of
                            marijuana.</P>

                        <p>Fiber crops are characterized by having a large concentration of cellulose, which is what
                            gives them their strength. The fibers may be chemically modified, like in viscose (used to
                            make rayon and cellophane). In recent years, materials scientists have begun exploring
                            further use of these fibers in composite materials. Due to cellulose being the main factor
                            of a plant fiber's strength, this is what scientists are looking to manipulate to create
                            different types of fibers.

                            Fiber crops are generally harvestable after a single growing season, as distinct from trees,
                            which are typically grown for many years before being harvested for such materials as wood
                            pulp fiber or lacebark. In specific circumstances, fiber crops can be superior to wood pulp
                            fiber in terms of technical performance, environmental impact or cost.[2]

                            There are a number of issues regarding the use of fiber crops to make pulp.[3] One of these
                            is seasonal availability. While trees can be harvested continuously, many field crops are
                            harvested once during the year and must be stored such that the crop doesn't rot over a
                            period of many months. Considering that many pulp mills require several thousand tonnes of
                            fiber source per day, storage of the fiber source can be a major issue.

                            Botanically, the fibers harvested from many of these plants are bast fibers; the fibers come
                            from the phloem tissue of the plant. The other fiber crop fibers are hard/leaf fibers (come
                            from the entirety of plant vascular bundles) and surface fibers (come from plant epidermal
                            tissue).[1]</p>

                        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>HARVESTING CROPS</u></h2>
                        <p class="p-align">Methods for growing and harvesting crops have developed over thousands of
                            years. The earliest crops were grown in Mesopotamia around 5500 B.C.E. These crops,
                            indigenous to an agriculturally rich area called the Fertile Crescent, were grown near local
                            sources of freshwater so they could be irrigated relatively easily. Wheat, barley, and figs
                            were among the first crops.

                            The development of agriculture led to more sophisticated methods of harvesting crops. Crop
                            rotation was the most significant innovation. In crop rotation, one crop is planted one
                            year, then a different crop is planted the next year on the same land. This helps preserve
                            the soil and reduce the chance for disease.

                            Crop rotation and fertilization, which makes soil more productive, allowed farmers to grow
                            more crops on less land. These innovations also allowed crops to be grown in areas where
                            they might not grow naturally. Improved engineering allowed rivers to be dammed and diverted
                            to provide water for crops. All of these developments increased the abundance of crops,
                            which could be used for trade and industrial use.

                            Today, agriculture is the largest industry in the world. Millions of people harvest crops
                            for subsistence or business purposes. Some tools used to harvest crops have not changed in a
                            thousand years—plows, rakes, sickles. Most of all, harvesting crops still relies on human
                            labor.</p>
                        <p>
                            Harvesting is the operation of gathering the useful part or parts of the plant and is
                            carried out at the time when all the nutrients have developed and the edible parts have
                            reached the appropriate degree of maturity.

                            In general, the harvest takes place 10 or 15 days after the grain has reached physiological
                            maturity. At the time of maturity, the grain has specific moisture content and special
                            physical characteristics. The most appropriate time of harvest is determined based upon the
                            length of the growing cycles (which differ according to the crop and varieties) and also the
                            degree of maturity of the grain.

                            The following Table shows the degrees of moisture content considered appropriate for good

                        <p>Harvesting of pulse crops is generally done by hand with simple farming implements like
                            sickle or by machines when the pods are ripe but not yet open. To harvest the pulse crops by
                            hand, the plants are pulled up and allowed to pre-dry in the sun. This operation should be
                            done early in the morning, while the dampness of the night minimizes the risk of shattering
                            losses. In some places, before the harvest, the plants are treated with chemical defoliants.
                            This treatment is intended to hasten drying of the plants and reduce the quantity of plant
                            matter to prevent its slowing up threshing operations. On an average, it takes about 80-100
                            man-hours per hectare to cut the plants by sickle.

                            Mechanized harvesting of legumes is usually done with combine-harvesters designed for wheat
                            but adapted for pulses crops. However, it be used only in large fields and that too which
                            has been levelled before sowing and then planted with varieties which are erect in nature
                            and reach maturity simultaneously. The capacity of these machines generally varies from 0.9–
                            1.1 h/ha. Mechanized harvesting in case of pulse crops is minimal due to unavailability of
                            mechanical harvesters at affordable price. However, some designs of reapers are available
                            which can be used for harvesting of chickpea. The use of such machines should be encouraged
                            to cut down the cost of harvesting and thereby reducing the cost of production.
