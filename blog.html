                        <h2><u>Plowing Of Land</u></h2>
                        <p>With “plowing” it’s intended that process which allows to remove horizontal clods from the
                            soil. The clods then will be rolled over and destroyed in order to bring the soil back to
                            its original phase, helping the passage of organic substances, providing space and
                            nutriments to the new crop.Usually, plowing is done at the end of the harvesting process.
                            The aim of this technique is in fact to eliminate the weeds and most of all the residues of
                            the previous crop, bringing them down in depth so they cannot influence the growth of the
                            plants. In this way it’s possible to soften the soil and gradually prepare it for the next
                            crop.Plowing can be performed in different periods during the year, even though the best
                            results are obtained in the mid-seasons. With autumn plowing in fact, crop residues, organic
                            fertilizers are buried down the soil in a contextual period, with increase of rainfalls and
                            lowering of the temperature degrees. In this regard, a lower temperature implies frosting
                            and defrosting action, causing a quick breaking of the clods.For what concerns springtime,
                            plowing has mainly a prevention goal. It’s performed just before the seeding to avoid the
                            hardening of the clods, cau by the gradual appearance of the sun and of the warm.On the
                            other hand, during summertime, plowing is usually reserved to clayey soil, which has
                            particular needs (for example, becomes impractical during the heavy rain, typical of autumn
                            season) There are various reasons because, still today, plowing is considered a very
                            important technique for the seedbed preparation. Here below we will analyze the main
                            advantages which can be brought by this process.The ideal structure of the soil is restored.
                            plowing-2Mixing the clods, rolling them over and leave the space on the surface to a “new”
                            field which has not been previously intensively cultivated, which helps the birth and the
                            growth of the future new plant. It in fact, will be able to find the proper space to expand
                            its roots.The new field will be waterproof and rich of oxygen. With plowing, the soil is
                            renovated: as consequence, it increases its porosity, which is essential for the passage of
                            water, oxygen and other organic substances. Furthermore, the residues of the previous crops,
                            which are brought in depth by the plough, become source of nutriments for the new plant;
                            There’s a strict control on weeds. Rolling up the soil also means destroying the weeds and
                            reduce the activity of animal parasites which prevent or make more difficult the growth of
                            the crop.There are various reasons because, still today, plowing is considered a very
                            important technique for the seedbed preparation.</p>

                        <h2><u>Planting Crop</u></h2>
                        <p>Early planting usually, but not always, results in maximum corn yields. Under central and
                            western New York conditions, corn planted in late April or early May typically out yields
                            either grain or silage corn planted after mid-May (Figure 3.1.1). Early-planted corn also
                            matures earlier, resulting in lower moisture and grain drying costs at harvest, and lodges
                            less. A general guideline for the best time to begin planting corn is about 10 days before
                            the average date of the last 32°F temperature in the spring. If soil conditions are too wet
                            at this time, wait until soil conditions improve. Corn planted in late May under dry soil
                            conditions will consistently out yield corn planted in late April under wet soil conditions.
                            Conversely, if it is warm and dry any time after April 15th in central/western NY, corn
                            growers should be ready to begin planting. Modern corn hybrids tolerate cold soil conditions
                            and seed treatments protect corn from soil pest problems under extended emergence time due
                            to cold soil temperatures.Planting depths of about 1.5 inches for silty clay or clay loam
                            soils and 1.75 to 2.0 inches for silt loam and gravelly loam soils are recommended for April
                            or early May-planted corn. Planting depths of about 1.75 to 2.0 inches for silty clay or
                            clay loam soils and 2.0 to 2.5 inches for silt loam and gravelly loam soils are recommended
                            for most planting dates in May. If soil conditions are dry in the top 2 inches in late May
                            and early June, corn can be safely planted to a depth of 3 inches on silt loam and gravelly
                            loam soils.To achieve the full yield potential of an early planting date, full-season
                            hybrids (hybrids that match the growing degree days in a region) are necessary (Figure
                            3.1.1). After the first or second week of May, however, the yield advantage of full-season
                            vs. medium-season hybrids decreases when planted for grain. Furthermore, full-season hybrids
                            may not mature, resulting in low test weight, and/or will have high grain moisture at
                            harvest, if planted after the second week of May. Therefore, for grain production,
                            full-season hybrids should be planted only in late April or during the first 2 weeks of May.
                            For silage production, full-season hybrids can be planted until about May 20. Growers should
                            not plant more than 30% of their crop to full-season hybrids. The majority of corn acreage
                            (~60%) should be planted to medium-season hybrids (100 and 200 growing degree days less than
                            the growing degree days in a region for silage and grain, respectively).If planting must be
                            delayed until early June, early-season hybrids (300-400 growing degree days less than the
                            growing degree days in a region for silage and grain, respectively) are recommended. A graph

                            Effect of planting date on grain yields.The optimal corn population depends on soil type,
                            hybrid selection, and crop use. For many New York soils (well-to moderately well-drained to
                            somewhat poorly drained silt or clay loams), numerous Cornell experiments have shown that
                            modern hybrids still require a harvest population of only 26,000 to 28,000 plants per acre
                            for maximum economic grain yields (Table 3.1.1). Droughty soils, however, cannot support
                            high populations, and plant populations should be adjusted downward (Table 3.1.1). Likewise,
                            hybrids differ in their response to plant populations, so hybrid selection should influence
                            whether the harvest population is at the high or low end of the recommended range for each
                            particular soil condition (Table 3.1.1). Also, most hybrids require higher harvest
                            populations for silage than for grain production, about 5,000 more plants per acre (Table
                            3.1.1).Planting date, tillage practices, pest problems, planter performance, and hybrid
                            selection influence actual corn populations obtained in the field. To compensate for
                            potential problems, it should be assumed that only 90 percent of the kernels planted
                            actually emerge and survive to become harvestable plants in the fall. To obtain 27,000
                            plants per acre at harvest on a moderately well-drained silt- loam soil, the planting rate
                            should be about 30,000 plants per acre (27,000 divided by 0.90). In some situations such as
                            a no-till situation or an April planting date, it should be assumed that only 85 percent of
                            the kernels will emerge and survive. The planting rate in these situations on a moderately
                            well-drained silt-loam soil should be about 31,765 plants per acre (27,000 divided by 0.85).

                        <h2><u>Watering the Crop</u></h2>
                        <p>The plant roots suck or extract water from the soil to live and grow. The main part of this
                            water does not remain in the plant, but escapes to the atmosphere as vapour through the
                            plant's leaves and stem. This process is called transpiration. Transpiration happens mainly
                            during the day time.Water from an open water surface escapes as vapour to the atmosphere
                            during the day. The same happens to water on the soil surface and to water on the leaves and
                            stem of a plant. This process is called evaporation.The water need of a crop thus consists
                            of transpiration plus evaporation. Therefore, the crop water need is also called
                            "evapotranspiration". The water need of a crop is usually expressed in mm/day, mm/month or
                            mm/season.Suppose the water need of a certain crop in a very hot, dry climate is 10 mm/day.
                            This means that each day the crop needs a water layer of 10 mm over the whole area on which
                            the crop is grown (Fig. 5). It does not mean that this 10 mm has to indeed be supplied by
                            rain or irrigation every day.It is, of course, still possible to supply, for example, 50 mm
                            of irrigation water every 5 days. The irrigation water will then be stored in the root zone
                            and gradually be used by the plants: every day 10 mm.A certain crop grown in a sunny and hot
                            climate needs per day more water than the same crop grown in a cloudy and cooler climate.
                            There are, however - apart from sunshine and temperature - other climatic factors which
                            influence the crop water need. These factors are the humidity and the windspeed (see Fig.
                            6). When it is dry, the crop water needs are higher than when it is humid. In windy climates
                            the crops will use more water than in calm climates.The highest crop water needs are thus
                            found in areas which are hot, dry, windy and sunny. The lowest values are found when it is
                            cool, humid and cloudy with little or no wind.From the above it is clear that one crop grown
                            in different climatic zones will have different water needs. For example, a certain maize
                            variety grown in a cool climate will need less water per day than the same maize variety
                            grown in a hotter climate.It is therefore useful to take a certain standard crop or
                            reference crop and determine how much water this crop needs per day in the various climatic
                            regions. As a standard crop or reference crop grass has been chosen.The crop type has an
                            influence on the daily water needs of a fully grown crop; i.e. the peak daily water needs: a
                            fully developed maize crop will need more water per day than a fully developed crop of
                            onions.The crop type has an influence on the duration of the total growing season of the
                            crop. There are short duration crops, e.g. peas, with a duration of the total growing season
                            of 90-100 days and longer duration crops, e.g. melons, with a duration of the total growing
                            season of 120-160 days. And then there are, of course, the perennial crops that are in the
                            field for many years, such as fruit trees.While, for example, the daily water need of melons
                            may be less than the daily water need of peas, the seasonal water need of melons will be
                            higher than that of beans because the duration of the total growing season of melons is much
                            longer.

                            Manures are derived from milk-producing dairy animals, egg-producing poultry, and animals
                            raised for meat and hide production, or sport and recreation. Manure is an abundant resource
                            with estimations for cattle manure in the US alone reaching two billion tons annually, and
                            one hen has the potential to produce a cubic foot of manure every six months. By adding
                            manure to crops it adds nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, magnesium and calcium.
                            While also increasing soil stability by increasing organic material, increasing water
                            infiltration, it can add bacteria diversity and over time reduce the impacts of soil
                            erosion.However, there is organic manure and non-organic manure. In order for manure to be
                            considered organic it must come from organic livestock or certified organic growers.If
                            organic manure is not available, they are permitted to use non-organic manure as long as the
                            animals have room to roam, are not kept in the dark, and growers abstain from using
                            genetically modified feeds.Fresh manure, right from the stall, can cause issues because it
                            can be too high in ammonia, or contain bacteria from the animal’s gut. This can have an
                            adverse effect on plants as the ammonia can burn the roots and microbes from the animal’s
                            gut can harm the microorganisms in the soil, killing them, or contaminate produce, such as
                            E. coli and salmonella.There is also a risk of introducing weeds, as seeds can pass through
                            the gut of an animal relatively unharmed, or there can be seeds in the bedding of the
                            livestock, which is often mixed in with the manure. Therefore, manure is required to be
                            composted which will ideally kill any seeds or pathogens and reduce the ammonia content.A
                            large commercial compost operation Chicken litter, which consists of chicken manure and
                            bedding, is an organic fertilizer that has been proposed to be superior for conditioning
                            soil for harvest to synthetic fertilizers. It contains similar minerals to other manures,
                            while also having trace amounts of copper, zinc, magnesium, boron, and chloride.[13]
                            Depending on the type of chicken litter obtained, it may contain bird remains. This type of
                            chicken litter should not be spread on crops, and can pose a risk to grazing livestock due
                            to botulism, a disease caused by bacteria within decaying birds.Horse manure contains the
                            perfect balance of Carbon to Nitrogen for composting (30:1) and is a traditional garden soil
                            amendment. However, careful organic sourcing is critical because feed (and bedding
                            materials) from fields treated with the picolinic acid family of herbicides including
                            aminopyralid, clopyralid, and picloram (marketed in the US as Milestone and Grazon-) can
                            pass through a horse’s digestive tract, remaining unchanged in manure and compost piles for
                            long periods. These chemicals commonly affect potatoes, tomatoes, and beans, causing
                            deformed plants and poor or non-existent yields. Also, horse de-wormers like Ivermectin can
                            be detected in manure at levels harmful to beneficial insects and organisms for up to 45
                            days. Tainted compost can not only kill plants and beneficial organisms, but can create
                            liability issues for owners.Bat guano has been used as a fertilizer for thousands of years,
                            most prominently by the Incans, who valued bats and their guano so much, the penalty for
                            killing a bat was death. Bat guano is high in elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and
                            phosphorus. Guano typically contains about 10% nitrogen, which helps plants keep a healthy
                            and vibrant green color and promotes rapid growth. Guano compared to manufactured
                            fertilizers is safe to use inside and outside of the house, large gardens or small plants,
                            and does not leach from the soil but rather remains and continues to slowly feed the plants
                            and enhance the soil. Guano is also rich in bio-remediation microbes which helps to clean
                            unnatural toxins from the soil that can prevent plant growth and cause rapid decay.Urine,
                            from humans as well as animals, is a fertilizer: urea in urine is a nitrogen compound, and
                            urine also contains phosphorus and potassium. Human urine typically has about 3 times as
                            much nitrogen as potassium, and more than 20 times as much nitrogen as phosphorus.[21][22]
                            The amount of potassium in urine is variable, and depends on the amount of potassium in the
                            person's diet. While animal urine, as from cattle and pigs, is widely used on farmer's
                            fields, human urine other than as part of sewage sludge is not currently allowed to be used
                            in any[clarification needed] commercial agricultural operations. However, there are ongoing
                            studies that have shown that aging urine in closed containers for 12–16 months eliminates
                            99% of harmful bacteria, due to increasing urea content and therefore pH.Animal by-products.
                            When any animal is butchered, only about 40% to 60% of the live animal is converted to
                            market product, with the remaining 40% to 60% classed as by-products. These by-products of
                            animal slaughter, mostly inedible—blood, bone, feathers, hides, hoofs, horns, -- can be
                            refined into agricultural fertilizers including blood meal, bone meal fish meal, and feather
                            meal.Processed organic fertilizers include compost, liquid plant manures, humic acid, grain
                            meal, amino acids, and seaweed extracts. Other examples are natural enzyme-digested
                            proteins. Decomposing crop residue (green manure) from prior years is another source of
                            fertility.Compost provides little in the means of nutrients to plants, but it does provide
                            soil stability through increasing organic matter. Compost does help microorganisms
                            proliferate which in turn breaks down decaying plant material into substantial bio-available
                            nutrients for plant to easily assimilate. Compost does not need to be fully plant-based: it
                            is often made with a mix of carbon-rich plant waste and nitrogen-rich animal waste including
                            human excreta as a means to remove pathogens and odor from the latter.Grain meals can be
                            made of corn gluten, alfalfa, cottonseed, or soybean. Most supply nitrogen and potassium,
                            but soybean meal provides nitrogen and phosphorus. When initially spread they can cause an
                            increase in ammonia within the soil and burn seeds, it is recommended to use these after
                            plants have developed, to ensure crop success.Other ARS studies have found that algae used
                            to capture nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from agricultural fields can not only prevent
                            water contamination of these nutrients, but also can be used as an organic fertilizer. ARS
                            scientists originally developed the "algal turf scrubber" to reduce nutrient runoff and
                            increase quality of water flowing into streams, rivers, and lakes. They found that this
                            nutrient-rich algae, once dried, can be applied to cucumber and corn seedlings and result in
                            growth comparable to that seen using synthetic fertilizers.

                        <h2><u> Natural Pesticide- agricultural</u></h2>
                        <p>Pesticide usage in some form or the other began soon after the birth of farming and the need
                            for grain storage. As we know them now, these artificial chemicals target and control pests
                            that assail crops. Insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, bactericides, et al are all termed
                            as pesticides.One of the most widely used pesticides, especially in developed countries, was
                            DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). However, as more people became aware of its pitfalls,
                            especially in the wake of “Silent Spring”, it was eventually banned. Today, DDT finds its
                            use in some developing countries in products such as mosquito repellents.Pesticides help
                            with pest control and reduce wastage of agricultural produce. With intensive levels of
                            farming, crops have become easy targets for pests. Pests damage crops, reduce yield and
                            raise costs. Hence, pesticides come into play to reduce such problems. This aids crop
                            productivity, but has a serious drawback. Pests can gradually mutate to become
                            pesticide-resistant. The farmer is thus faced with a bigger pest control problem than the
                            one he initially had.Unable to differentiate between the good and the bad, they are
                            responsible for wiping out nutrient generating micro-organisms. Sadly, the very chemicals
                            designed to improve productivity tend to hamper it through the reduction in soil fertility.
                            One reason for this side effect is the negative effect on nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen
                            fixation converts the nitrogen in the air to ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds. The
                            lack of such a process affects plant growth. It damages the plant population and leads to
                            adverse effects on the larger ecosystem.An impact on the local ecosystems can greatly affect
                            bird, animal and insect population. Insecticides can wipe out insect colonies such as those
                            of bees which are mainly responsible for pollination.Pesticide toxicity accumulates as you
                            go up the food chain. Through leaching, these chemicals seep into groundwater and
                            contaminate a wide area. Animals and humans consume this water which leads to toxicity
                            build-up throughout the animal food chain.Inorganic pesticides can cause acute or delayed
                            poisoning in humans. Due to their toxicity, some can disrupt endocrine glands and negatively
                            impact nervous systems. Severe cases of pesticide exposure even cause cancer.Human exposure
                            occurs in a variety of ways. Through inhalation, consuming food products like grains, fruits
                            and vegetables with trace amounts of pesticides or by drinking water contaminated by these
                            pest targeting chemicals.Pesticide exposure can take two forms. High-level exposure or
                            low-level long-term exposure.People living in rural areas, especially farmers and their
                            families are at a higher risk because of their direct involvement in spraying pesticides on
                            crops. They can also get exposed by consuming contaminated groundwater drawn from
                            wells.Children do not have fully developed immune systems and are more vulnerable to side
                            effects. Trace amounts of pesticides which enter their bodies tend to accumulate. This leads
                            to increased toxicity in their systems, which interferes in their development while growing
                            up.Health is a factor that almost no one wishes to compromise on. As a result, to the
                            21st-century consumer, it is clear that the harmful side effects of pesticides outweigh the
                            short-term benefits of these chemicals. The negative effect of pesticides is undeniable.
                            Alternatives to these inorganic or synthetic chemicals include Integrated Pest Management
                            and organic or bio-pesticides.But with regards to grain storage, the prevalent practice
                            still remains to spray pesticides (organic or inorganic) on grains before sealing them away.
                            However, even organic ones such as organophosphates are not fully non-contaminating. They
                            leave behind residue even in the best cases.An alternative to pesticide dependent grain
                            storage is storage using hermetic bags. These bags provide air-tight storage solutions. They
                            stop the exchange of oxygen with outside air and promote anaerobic storage. Not only does
                            this naturally and speedily stop pest growth, but it also preserves the aroma and freshness
                            of the grains.In a generation that has realized the importance of natural and organic food,
                            SaveGrain Bags has taken the initiative to create an organic grain storage solution. Its
                            bags reduce the use of pesticides and are completely recyclable.

                        <h2><u>Harvesting Crop</u></h2>
                        <p>When the crop matures, it is cut for further process. This is known as harvesting. It is done
                            by labor and with the sickle, mechanical harvesting is used these days – machines such as
                            combine harvesters are used. Harvesting depends on many factors like season, crop variety,
                            maturity period, etc. Reaping is the cutting of crops for harvest, by using a scythe,
                            sickle, or reaper. Manually harvesting is done by using sickles but it is an unvaried job as
                            well as time taking. In recent times, machines called harvesters are used for harvesting,
                            especially wide-ranging farming harvesting, threshing of the crop has to be carried
                            out.Threshing is the procedure, in which, the collected grains are separated from the husks
                            by beating or by the threshing machine. In small-scale farming, husks and grains are
                            separated from each other by a procedure called winnowing. Harvesting is contemplated as a
                            festival in most parts of the country. It is a time of joy where the fruits of the hard work
                            of farmers come into reality. harvesting festivals are Pongal, Bihu, etc.Methods of
                            harvestingManual harvesting: Hand harvesting is a technique for manually or by hand picking
                            grains, fruits, vegetables, leaves, etc.Harvesting with Hand Tools: Crops are harvested by
                            farmers using a few tools. Harvesting using hand tools includes using a little axe, a big
                            axe, a darat, a gandasa, a small sickle, etc.Machine harvesting: Machine harvesting is the
                            practice of gathering large quantities of grains with the aid of contemporary harvesters. A
                            contemporary harvester can work in tandem with other massive gear to simultaneously cut and
                            clean the grains.Reaping: Reaping is the process of removing mature panicles and straws that
                            have grown above the ground.Threshing: Threshing is the process of separating the food
                            grains—such as paddy, wheat, etc.—from the rest of the cut crop.Cleaning: Cleaning is a
                            crucial step in the harvesting process, and it largely entails figuring out how to get
                            immature and non-grain particles, dust, and other contaminants out of edible food
                            grains.Stacking/Piling: Stacking is a technique for piling or stacking harvested crops for
                            storage.Bagging: The final step in the harvesting process is bagging. For storage and
                            transportation, the threshed grains are kept in gunny bags.Storage Small-scale farmers use
                            the harvested crop for their own consumption, whereas large-scale production is mostly used
                            for marketing. As a result, the farmers must store the grains. For this, suitable storage
                            space must be set up. A significant loss of grain might result from inadequate storage space
                            and poor storage practices.In addition to insects and rodents, the stored grains may be
                            attacked by bacteria, fungi, and environmental factors including moisture and temperature.
                            Therefore, the grains must be properly treated before being stored. Pesticides can be used
                            to stop rodent infestations. Fungal growth on grains is a result of a damp environment.
                            Grain drying properly in the sun will prevent this.Fumigation is another technique that uses
                            chemicals to stop bacteria and other microbes. Grain must be properly treated before being
